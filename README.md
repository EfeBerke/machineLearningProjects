# Machine Learning Practice & Mini Projects

This repository contains my **machine learning practice labs and mini projects**, primarily based on the **DeepLearning.AI Machine Learning Specialization**, along with additional experiments developed independently while learning.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong fundamentals** by implementing algorithms from scratch and visualizing their behavior, rather than relying on high-level libraries prematurely.

---

## Contents

- Practice labs following the DeepLearning.AI curriculum
- Mini projects created alongside the learning process
- Experiments focused on optimization, numerical computation, and visualization

---

## Topics Covered (Current)

- Linear Regression
- Cost and loss functions
- Gradient Descent
- Vectorized numerical computation
- Visualization of learning dynamics

---

## Tools & Libraries

Currently used:
- **NumPy** – numerical computation and vectorization
- **Matplotlib** – plotting data, loss curves, and model behavior

Additional libraries will be added as the learning path progresses.

---

## Learning Approach

- Algorithms are implemented **from scratch** for clarity
- Focus on **math–code alignment**
- Code evolves incrementally as concepts become clearer

This repository is **learning-oriented**, not production software.
